# Role Playing Game Manager Obsidian Plugin 

Role Playing Game Manager (RPG Manager or RPGM) is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin that helps you outline and manage your Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) stories. 

## Introduction
RPG Manager helps you create the plot of a story, organising, and referencing elements where they are used. The plugin revolves around three main types of features: 
- **Plotting**: When you develop the rough sequence of events in the story.
- **Running**: When you run play within the story such as when you are actively playing a session. 
- **Elements**: The individual pieces that may be present in your story, including non-player-characters (NPCs), locations, items, and governments. 

THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING HERE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YET

## Goals
The **Primary Goal** of RPG Manager is to lower the time needed to write a story, increase the quality of writing produced by narrowing focus, and to increase the quality of the sessions you run for your players. It accomplishes this by incorporating a combination of **[And, But, Therefore](documentation/plots/abt.md)** (ABT) and [**Story Circle**](documentation/plots/storycircle.md) (SC) Frameworks in the plugin. These additions are optional features and can be disabled. 

The **Secondary Goal** of RPG Manager is to provide a story or campaign management system framework within Obsidian that is, at its core, system agnostic. It is intended to work for authors of all genres, DnD, Genesys, Sectors without Numbers, Vampire: The Masquerade, Warhammer, Warcraft, and more. If RPG Manager cannot support it, we [**want to know about it**](https://github.com/carlonicora/obsidian-rpg-manager/issues) so we can correct it.
